Introduction
============

CircuitPython module for the MCP23S17 SPI I/O extenders.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
====================

It is not available yet, since I just created this independetly from the MCP230xx library from adafruit. 
I hope they can upload this to pypi.

Download to your project
====================
Download the entire folder. It must be named as it is adafruit_mcp23sxx. Then copy and past this folder in your 
project. 

Usage Example
=============

See examples/mcp230xx_simpletest.py for a demo of the usage and the examples/mcp23s17_expandable_mcp23017_cs.py, to 
learn how to use a total of 6 MCP23S17 and use 1 MCP23017 as chip select controller.
